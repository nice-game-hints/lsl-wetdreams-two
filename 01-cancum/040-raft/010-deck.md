No deck, no ship.

# Where to get it?
You need something large and rectangular.

# What could it be?
Like, a table?

# A table!
There is the table with the sausages from Lefty. You should use that!

# Yes! How?
It is up there, next to the wedding cake.

# What to do?
Did you look down from up there? You can see that the cliff goes to the beach.

# So...
Maybe pushin the table down would be a logical move.

# How?
Lift up the tablecloth.

# And?
Release the brake and push the table down.

# How can I use it
Take a picture of it. Then use the picture of the table as the deck in the blueprint app.
