Without a sail you won't get anywhere.

# A sail...
You know, large piece of cloth or similar.

# The awning?
On top the donkey? Good idea, but it is full of holes.

# What else?
Well, you had a pile of clothes in your room.

# The underwear?
Yes. Use the photo of the underwear as the sail in the blueprint app.
