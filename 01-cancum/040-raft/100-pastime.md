Alone on the stranded island. Who could you "talk" to?

# Wilson?
Heh, nice. There is a volleyball near the donkey.

# I have it
Maybe it would need a face!

# How?
Get a lipstick ^[ It is right of the ladder to Larry's room. ]. Draw some face to the ball.

# Beautiful!
It is still missing something...

# What?
Hair. Use the seaweed on the ball.

# Wilma!
How nice...
