Quick, you need to get out of Canc√∫m. Build a raft.

# How?
Did you visit the beach? And check out the poster on the wall?

# I did!
So, you should now have the blueprint app. Follow the instructions. You need just:
 - [The deck](010-deck.md)
 - [The mast](020-mast.md)
 - [The sail](030-sail.md)
 - [The floats](040-floats.md)
 - [A communication device](050-comm.md)
 - [The rudder](060-rudder.md)

# It is ready!
Cool, off you go! You can optionally make yourself [some pastime activity](100-pastime.md).
