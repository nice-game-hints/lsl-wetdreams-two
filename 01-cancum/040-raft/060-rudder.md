To steer the raft, you need a rudder.

# How to build it?
It consists of two parts. The paddle to make the steering and some kind of support for it.

# So?
There is the pizza paddle at Lefto's. Take it.

# And the support?
Take the stick from the wall. Combine them in the inventory to build a rudder. Use it in the blueprint app.
