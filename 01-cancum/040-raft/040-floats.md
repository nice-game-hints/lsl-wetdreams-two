The floats keep the raft from sinking.

# What is floating?
All kinds of stuff with air in them.

# Air...
Collect some plastic bottles to use as a float for the raft.

# Where?
Look around. You should collect **bagloads** of plastic bottles for the raft to carry you.

Do you want me to tell you all the places?

# Yes!
 - In the sand in front of the narwhal (at the beach)
 - Left of the narwhal in the ocean (at the beach)
 - In the pile of sand (at the beach)
 - In the ocean, at right (at the beach)
 - In the narwhal's maw (at the beach)
 - Bag of plastic bottles hanging (at the Lefto's)

# I collected them all
Nice. Use the **bagloads** (make sure it is this term) of plastic bottles as the floats in the blueprint app.
