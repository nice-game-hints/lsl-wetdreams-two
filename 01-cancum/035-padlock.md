The wardrobe padlock is locked.

# Where's the key?
Didn't you have one? Did you try the padlock and then ask around?

# I did
I think you got one from El Rey at some point. Go ask him. You have to try out the padlock first and then you get the option "Do you know where I can get the key..."

# I got the key
Great! Now you can open the wardrobe and put on your stylish wedding suit.
