You would need to find someone from the island to feed the guests.

# Someone?
Well, there aren't many, aren't there?

# Lefty?
Exactly! Go talk to him.

# The meat grinder is stuck
Bummer! Did you try to jank the crank?

# It is rusty
Rusty, you say? So, it would need some... oiling? Or lubrication?

# Lubrication?
There is a lube tube on a chair in Larry's room. Larry has used it for... um... well... lubricating the chair?

# I found it
Lubricate the crank with the lubrication.

# It turns again!
Great. Tell Lefty so that he can make some sausages to your party.
