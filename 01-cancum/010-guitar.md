El Rey's guitar string is broken. Go try to find a replacement. Touch and try everything!

# Everything?
Yes, everything.

# Even the self-destruction button?
Oh, hm... Would it self-destruct twice, though? Push it.

# It broke
Phew. That was close.

# Now what?
Oh, the string. Yeah, what to do? Did you notice something happening when you pushed the button?

# What?
It spurted a wire out.

# A wire!
It makes a perfect guitar string. Give it to El Rey.
