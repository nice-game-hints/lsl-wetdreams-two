title: Navigating the Prune maze with Nari's note
---

You should look at the note Nari left you. The objects in the room tell to which direction _not_ to move. Note that you can go back to the door you came into the room. As long as you come to new room you are doing fine. If you make a mistake, you are back at the cages.

Also note the color of the bins. The instructions only apply to blue and red bins. The yellow has no effect.

In this room you should not go _west_ (dog barking) and not go _east_ (red light). Nothing is telling you not to go north. So the correct door is to the _north_.

# I found a room without any of these!
Go north. Where it says "Keep out". The door also has a sliding hole.
