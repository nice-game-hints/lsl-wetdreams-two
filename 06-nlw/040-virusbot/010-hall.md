There is a door with rusty lock in the Prune dungeons. Did you get to [the factory already](../030-plan/index.md)?

# Yes
Great. Then you got Wang's golden card.

# I have it
Did you visit upstairs?

# I did
You took some heavy stuff from there that will melt a metal lock.

# What?
Cerveza de los Barbaros

# Oh?
Pour the beer on the lock to melt it. You can now access the hall.
