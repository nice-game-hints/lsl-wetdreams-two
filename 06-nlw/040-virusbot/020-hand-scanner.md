There is a hand scanner. Wang's hand should open it. Do you have Wang's hand? If you don't, get [access to the factory](../030-plan/index.md), first.

# Yes, but it is little dry
It is. You should moisten it.

# Where?
Did you [open the locked door](010-hall.md), already?

# I did
Well, what did you find from there?

# What?
The water dispenser. Soak the hand there. Now you can use it to open the door.
