A chainsaw would be cool!

# Where do I get a chainsaw?
I think they use saws in caesarean sections. Did you get into the room behind [the hand scanner](020-hand-scanner.md)?

# Yes
Then you know that Med-O-Tron does emergency caesarean sections. With a saw! Start it.

# Sawing
Take the saw.

# It is running!
Stop it. Unplug the Med-O-Tron while the saw is running. You can grab the saw.
