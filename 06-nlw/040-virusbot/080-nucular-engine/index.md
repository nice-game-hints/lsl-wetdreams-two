Virus Bot could be enhanced with a more powerful _nucular_ engine.

# Nucular?
You have found all kinds of interesting stuff: a battery, cables, a _glass bottle_!

# Those sound familiar...
Of course. They are the ingredients of the helicopter nuclear engine!

# Right!
You still have the blueprint and you can build another engine.

# What should I use?
 - The glass bottle ^[ Found from Prune office. ]
 - Copper coil ^[ Found on the stage at the factory. ]
 - Cables ^[ Found on the floor in one of the rooms. ]
 - Battery ^[ Found on the floor in one of the rooms. ]
 - Mounting bracket ^[ Use the glue found from Prune office. ]
 - [Radioactive liquid](010-radioactive-liquid.md)

# I built it!
Nice! Put it into the Virus Bot.
