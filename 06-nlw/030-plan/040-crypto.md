There is a cryptocurrency ATM somewhere.

# Where?
You would need to get past that locked door. ^[ Use the id card you find from the headquarters table. ]

# I am there
Go far right and you find the ATM.

# It is not working
You need to [meet the smuggler](030-smuggler.md), first.

# Where do I put the money?
In a wallet. ^[ Talk to Nari about the darknet and cryptocurrencies. She will give you a wallet. ]

# I have them
Great. Now [find the darknet](050-darknet.md) to spend them all.
