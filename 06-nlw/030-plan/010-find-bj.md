You should follow Nari's instructions to find BJ's room in the labyrinth.

# What were they?
 - She started from the north and ended up coming _from_ a door north.
 - She never turned around and went through the same door
 - She used each direction twice
 - She only went to the same direction after she has gone in every direction before
 - She never went counter-clockwise

# Too complicated
Think that you are creating a path of eight door opens (each direction twice, so 2xN, 2xS, 2xW, 2xE). It starts with N (start from north) and ends up in S (end up coming _from_ a door from north).

NXXXXXXS

Distribute these (NEEWWS) to replace Xs.

# More hints, please
She never turned around. So no combinations of NS, SN, EW, WE.

# More
No counter-clockwise. So no combinations of NW, WS, SE, EN.

# More?
Only go to same direction after done every direction before. So the first four letters are a combination of NSWE and the last four letters are a combination of NWES.

# Show me!
Here is one working combination: NESWWNES
