Piper gets Brutus out while you are napping. After that Brutus blocks your access to the garden.

# Good dog
Yeah, but still blocking. Give it some food from the fridge.

# There is not enough
You would have to get its bone from outside before noon. Then you can give it the food **and** the bone. It will let you move to the garden.
