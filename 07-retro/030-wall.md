Pipers has built a fancy 3d wall in front of the basement door.

# 3D wall?
Do you remember what Faith said to you at some point?

# What?
About the pool?

# What about it?
[Drain it.](040-pool.md)

# It is empty
When you go down there you find a huge graphics card. Break it. ^[ Use the stick that is outside. Stick it into the backup fan. ]

# It broke
Now the wall is gone from the basement door.
