According to Swingle's file the captain sailed his ship, Unsatisfied, away from the archipelago but it sank. First you need to find _where_ it sank.

# Who to ask?
Go ask around. Someone must know something.

# Bobbi?
She knows but won't tell you. Talk to Shauni about money. She says there is a cryptocurency firm headquarters at a reef that has sunk many ships during the centuries. Ask more about the reef.

# I got the location
So, the location is -20 and 3. But your raft should have [bumbers](010-bumbers.md) on both ends so that it doesn't end up wrecked.

# I have the bumbers
Set sail to location -20, 3.

# I got there!
You need more hints about the sunken ship. Go explore [the reef](020-reef/index.md).

# I got some coordinates
So, your next location is -11, -13. You need to dive into the ocean. Click on the dive site.

# Dive?
You know, hold your breath. Look around. ^[ There is a diving brochure at the beach where Shauni was previously. ]

# I have diving instructions
Use the brochure on the diving site (middle of the sea).

# Found it!
[Open the door.](030-unsatisfied.md)

# Door, open
Get the keystone from him.
