You found Unsatisfied. Now, get in there to find the keystone.

# How?
Through the door?

# It is stuck
Hmm.. could you _blow_ your way into it?

# With the bomb?
Yup.

# How?
Lift it up a little, first. With something buoyant.

# Like?
The waterwings.

# I need to attach them
Use the net. Take the fishing net and attach it to the bomb. Then use the waterwings on the bomb.

# It's not moving
Maybe give it some push.

# With?
The server has that propeller. Maybe you could increase its speed.

# How?
Click on the input field, twice.
