To access that special reef the raft should have bumbers on its both ends.

# Bumbers?
You know, bumby stuff. Filled with air.

# Any hints?
Well, the first one is obvious. Take the crocodile from the pool side. Attach it to the raft.

# And the other?
The blow up doll that you find from Swingle's suite.

# How to inflate it?
It is filled through the penis.

# Okay?
There is a glorious hole where you can input penises.

# What?
Go to the toilets and use the blow up doll on the hole. Attach the inflated dude to the raft.
