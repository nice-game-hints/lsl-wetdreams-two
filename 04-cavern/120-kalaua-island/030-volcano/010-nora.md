Talk to Nora at the foot of the volcano. She is missing her climbing gear. She says her sister Dora (really?) took them into Gofuku jungle finding a specific plant.

# How to get them?
Get to Gofuku Island and go to the dense jungle on the right. [Help Dora with the flower](../../100-gofuku-island/050-flower/index.md) to get the climbing gear.
