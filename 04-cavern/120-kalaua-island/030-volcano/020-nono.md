Nono is giving hard time to Larry on top of the volcano.

# What to do?
Ask him to step aside.

# Weird
He is afraid of _pianos_?

# Yes
Could you fool him that there is a piano?

# How?
There is that speaking tube that goes down, to the foot of the volcano.

# So?
Play some piano music with your toy recorded using the generator. Nono is scared away.
