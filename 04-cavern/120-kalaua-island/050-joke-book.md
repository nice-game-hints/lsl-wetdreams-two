Lewis has lost his joke book and is now telling stories from a role playing book. Tell him that his joke are odd.

# Where to find it?
He said he had it in the festival. Maybe some other festival goer switched it?

# Who?
It was switched to _role-playing book_?

# So...
The nerds at Gofuku Island, behind the waterfall?

# Oh...
Go talk to them. Ask Finley and Kyle if they have seen it.

# They threw it away?
Somewhere outside the cave... Keep searching.

# Where?
Check out the bush that is immediately after the "bridge". It is there.

# Found it!
Take it back to Lewis.
