If you go to the jungle at Kalau'a Island you can see the mud spot next to the stone. Looks like a pig has had good time there. You have to [get past the abyss](020-abyss.md), first.

# A pig?
Probably the swine you freed earlier. Catch it.

# How?
I think it would like the buns that are offered at the buffet. Put the bun on the stone.

# It is there
Now visit other places. Like, get a new bun from the hotel buffet.

# Why?
You'll see. Go fetch the bun and get back.

# It ate the bun!
What did you expect. You have to get it to stay.

# How?
Maybe adding some substance to the bun to _disable_ the pig.

# Like?
Soak the bun in the vodka. Then put the soaked bun on the stone.

# It is there
Now visit the hotel, again. Get back and you find the pig there.
