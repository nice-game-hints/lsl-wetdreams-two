Yanmei escaped into her submarine with the keystone.

# How to get in?
There is the input device.

# What's the password?
"Ken sent me"

# No it is not
Right. You don't know it yet. If you would have way of seeing Yanmei saying the password.

# The camera?
Whose camera that is? Look at it.

# Who?
Emma. Go talk to her and ask if you can watch the recording from the camera.

# I got it
Then go say it to the input device. Bravely now.
