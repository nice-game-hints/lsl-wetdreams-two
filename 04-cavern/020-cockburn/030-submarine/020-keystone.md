You've got [into the submarine](010-submarine-entry.md). Dig around the submarine.

# Alarm!
Quick, hide!

# Where?
Behind the curtain? Into the iron maiden?

# She finds me!
Sometimes she does. But how to get the keystone. Dig up some more. Try to hide succesfully from her couple of times. She does not guess the same place twice in a row.

# What to do?
Activate the computer terminal. After couple of succesful hidings she should put the keystone into the safe soon afer.

# How to open the safe?
She has a key card on her belt. On the back.

# Okay?
If you would get her distracted and get close enough to catch it.

# How?
Mess the notes. Hide in the cardboard cutout. Then you can snatch the key card while she arranges the notes. She might still spot you so keep trying. Hide somewhere else once if she is coming to the cardboard every time.

# Got the keycard
Open the safe with it.
