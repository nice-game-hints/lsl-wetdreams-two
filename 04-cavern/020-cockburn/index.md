# Where next?
Bobbi? She is related to Cockburn. Ask her about him. Ask if you can have the stone downstairs.

# She said yes!
But you need to bring her [Regibald's signet ring](010-signet-ring.md).

# I have the ring
Great! Give it to Bobbi.

# What was that?
Kip? Get downstairs to get the keystone.

# Oh no!!
The keystone was stolen. Yanmei left a message.

# Hints?
 - The other place is where Larry was bound. ^[ Go to Faith's suite. There is a number on the mirror. ]
 - The other place is where John sits. ^[ The toilets! There is a number written on the wall. ]

# What are those?
They are coordinates. Navigate your raft to 10, 10.

# Found it
