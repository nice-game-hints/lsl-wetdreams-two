Something that Superior Sister Frigid _loved_?

# What did she love?
Well, she wanted to protect the girls. And keep them pure.

# Pure?
She probably would've liked to force them to wear a chastity belt all the time.

# Chastity belt?
There is a chastity belt at the altar in the prison lobby. Put the chastity belt into the voodoo bag.
