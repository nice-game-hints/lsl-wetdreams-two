Swingle is in the cage that is not locked but the alarm will go off if he is removed. Wendi forces you to put him back.

# What to do?
You should come up with a replacement swingle!

# Replacement?
You know, something that looks like him. He looks like a sausage with that costume of his.

# Sausage?
[Pork](../../../../120-kalaua-island/040-pig.md) sausage.

# I have the pig!
Great. It will make a perfect replacement Swingle.

# Just like that?
Of course not. Make it look more like Swingle.

# How?
It needs [a Swingle costume](010-swingle-costume.md) and some mustache ^[ Draw the mustache with the permanent marker you find from the camp behind the waterfall at Gofuku Island.] .

# Ready!
Now replace Swingle with the swine. Remember to lower the cage, first.
