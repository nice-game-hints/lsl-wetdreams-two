Swingle gave you a blueprint for the experience machine.

# How to build it?
Follow the blueprint:
 - A cooling relaxation tank ^[ The freezer is perfect. Take a picture of it and use that. ]
 - [An agent that reduces heartbeat](010-heartbeat.md)
 - A neck retainer ^[ There is a _neck retainer_ (the rope) at the beach on Kalau'a Island jungle. You have to get past [the gorge](../../../120-kalaua-island/020-abyss.md), first. ]
 - [Swingle](020-swingle.md) to be your experience companion.
