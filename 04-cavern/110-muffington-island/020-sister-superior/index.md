Superior Sister Frigid is a ghost that is ahaunting the cannibals at Muffington Island. You sould do them a great favor by driving her away.

# Where is she?
You can find her grave at the cemetery. Go right from the village yard. Deal with [Wendi](010-wendi.md), first. It is the prominent grave in the middle, on top of the pile of sand.

# I found the grave
You should now contact her.

# How?
Did you read the plaque on the wall?

# Yes?
It says to contact a dead person you need to add (into the voodoo bag, take it):
 - [Something that was loved](010-loved.md)
 - [Something from the body of a descendant](020-descendant.md)
 - [Something from the body of the deceased](030-deceased.md)
 - Wax to bind everything ^[ You find candles at Gofuku Island, behind the waterfall. ]
 - Then some fine spice ^[ Use the salt and pepper you find next to the cauldron on village yard. ]

# Everythin's in the bag
Great. Now just lay the bag on her grave to summon her.

# She is here!
Ask here about life after death. Talk to her about why she is haunting and that you can help her with, uh, spiritual desire things.

# She wants to have sex!
Yeah! But you are not in matching.. _forms_.

# What to do?
Is there some other _sexpert_ (besides Larry) that could help with otherworldly out-of-body sex experiences?

# You mean?
Swingle! Go talk to him. Ask him about out-of-body experiences.

# Experience machine
You got the blueprint for it. Go and [build it](050-machine/index.md)!
