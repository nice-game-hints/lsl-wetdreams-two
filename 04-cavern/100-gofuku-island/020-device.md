There is an interesting device behind the waterfall. There must be a way to activate it.

# How?
The light beam is surely the key here. You should reflect it with someting in the socket.

# What?
Use the hand mirror that you can find from the totem at Muffington Island.

# Something's missing
Yeah, the round area would need something.

# What?
Did you spot those round stone slabs around the island?

# I did
There is three of them. Put them into the device. The stone slabs can be found at:
 - The biggest is next to the device.
 - The middle one is right of the raft landing place.
 - The smallest is next to the ruins passage leaning on the rock. Left from the raft.

# They are in place
Now, if you move the slabs (click on the device) it will shine corresponding symbols on the wall.

# What to do with the symbols?
They are your key into [the ruins passage](010-ruins-passage.md).
