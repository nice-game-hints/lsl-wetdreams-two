The third room is dirty. I think this is a job for Intergalactic Janitor!

# Will Comply...
Yes, go tell him you have a great story and the place for him.

# What story?
Doesn't really matter but the last option has to be "...clean it!".

# He cleaned it
Now you can see the symbols.

# Which ones to pick?
Pull the lever to get some light beams. The top light beam will show the top slab symbols and so forth. Pull the lever when the symbols are in correct order and the door opens.
