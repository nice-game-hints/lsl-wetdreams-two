The first room after [entering the ruins](../010-ruins-passage.md) contains a lizard statue and a trap door with highly suspicious lever.

# What to do?
You need help. There are people on this island that are thrilled about traps and dangers and lizards.

# You mean?
The larpers, of course!

# Oh my...
Talk first to Kyle and Finley. Ask them all about LARPing.

After that talk to Smokey and the Red Shirt. Say you can be their game master. The first room a perfect place for their LARP. 

# They are there
Now, tell them the story.

# They don't like it
Hmm.. maybe you need more information about LARPs. If there would be a book about it.

# A book?
Who was reading a book?

# Who?
Lewis. His jokes were lame. Something about orcs and paladins. Go tell him that his jokes are odd. He is at the hotel, in the buffet room.

# Oh!
So, he lost his joke book and now he has a _role-playing book_?! Perfect.
You just have to find his [joke book](../120-kalaua-island/050-joke-book.md), first.

# I have the joke book
Give it to Lewis. You get the role-playing book to help tell better stories.

# I have the role-playing book
Great! Now you can tell them better story.

# What to answer?
Select always the last option.
 - a disembodied intelligence
 - a statue of a lizard
 - modulate your tricorder's pulse frequencey to Alpha Seven
 - clear your next move with Starfleet Command
