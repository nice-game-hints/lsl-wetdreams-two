Swingle's records show that the cavern is somewhere in the ruins of Gofuku Island. Go check left from the raft.

# There is the ruins entrance!
Well, [open it](../010-ruins.md)

# It is open!
You will encounter three rooms you should work through. They are full of danger and traps!

# How?
There are people on this island that are thrilled about traps and dangers.

# You mean?
The larpers, of course!

# Oh my...
Now, now... roleplayers are nice bunch.

# Cleared all of them!
And you found the cavern. To open it you need to have all [four keystones](../../index.md).
