The second room is dark. Turn on some lights. ^[ Use space bar to show the hotspots. Select the Sun symbol. ]

# Lights on!
Go invite next larpers to their perfect place.

# Who?
Kyle and Finley. Say that you have the perfect place for them.

# They are there
Now you have to inspire them with a great story.

# What should I tell them?
Again, pick the last options.
 - Leela, the most beautiful woman in the universe
 - Sexmania
 - A bikini made of gold

# They are ready
So, turn off the lights (the moon symbol) and guide them through the traps. Look at the passage to know more about the traps.

# Help!
The traps (and their correct options) are:
 - A deep pit (Tentacle monster) ^[ Leap forward. ]
 - A stone pendulum (Palace guards) ^[ Duck as low as you can. ]
 - Crushing ceiling trap (Walls start to fall) ^[ Roll forward. ]
 - Sharp arrow trap (Intergalactic death beams) ^[ Run ahead as fast as possible. ]
