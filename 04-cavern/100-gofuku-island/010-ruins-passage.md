It is protected by this symbol lock.

# How does it work?
You have to guess the correct symbols and then pull the lever.

# Okay
Right. Have you seen these symbols somewhere else? ^[ Go check behind the waterfall. ]

# Yes!
Behind the waterfall. On the stone wall. I think [that device](020-device.md) got something to do with it.

# The device is activated
Good, it will tell you the correct symbols. They go from upper most to lowest.

# How do I know the slab positions?
Oh, right! Peep into the hole in the passage. There you will see the symbols you should turn the slabs to match.

# Explain once more
First, you peep into the hole. It will show three symbols. Remember those!

Then, you get back to the device and turn the slabs to match the symbols.

The device will shine three symbols. Turn the slabs in the ruins passage to match the shined symbols. Top slab should have the same symbol that is the top most on the wall etc. Pull the lever after they are in correct order. One of the stones lights up.

Do this procedure three times and the door opens.

# Man, that took long!
I know, but you are now closer to [the cavern](060-cavern/index.md).
