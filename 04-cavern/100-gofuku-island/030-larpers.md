At Gofuku Island there is a group of LARPers behind the waterfall. They participated in the failed festival but are now doing a LARP. They only need a game master.

# I can be one!
First you need to talk to Finley and Kyle about LARPing.

# I did
Now talk each of them. They have their individual needs for perfect places to LARP.

# Where to find the places?
The places are on this island.

# Where?
[Open the ruins passage door](010-ruins-passage.md) to find the places.

# It is open
Then invite the correct group to [the first room](060-cavern/010-first-room.md).

# Cleared!
clear the other two rooms, also:
 - [Second room](060-cavern/020-second-room.md)
 - [Third room](060-cavern/020-third-room.md)
