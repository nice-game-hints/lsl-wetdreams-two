There is an interesting safe in Swingle's hotel room.

# How to input the code for it?
The code is entered by using the phone, logically.

# Okay, what's the code?
It is five numbers from one to five.

# Fine, but what is it?
You have to deduct it, first. You see any numbers anywhere in the room?

# The door?
Yup. That's the thing. Note anything more peculiar about the door?

# The colors?
Exactly!

# So?
Find something to match the colors and then you find the combination.

# Help!
Find following items:
 - The massage wand ^[ It is under the bed. ]
 - The tentacle ^[ It is behind the pillow. Move it first. ]
 - The beaver plug ^[ It is on top of the Wanky Hankies. ]
 - The ball gag ^[ Open the wardrobe door. It is hanging there. ]
 - The strap-on dildo ^[ Pull from the suspicious lever. ]

# I have those!
Five items, five numbers.

# More help!
And five colors in the wardrobe door, remember? Close the wardrobe door.

# So, I should...
...match the sex toy's color to the color on the wardrobe door. Try putting some of the on the marks. You can select the position of the toy.

# Can't do it
First, the light red one is the beaver plug. Put the plug on the left most vertical line. Then do the same to others.

# Show me
The order is
 - The beaver plug
 - The tentacle
 - The massage wand
 - The strap-on dildo
 - The ball gag

# What next?
Go to the phone and dial the code: 23451. It is only available if you have put the toys in their correct positions. You can now open the safe.
