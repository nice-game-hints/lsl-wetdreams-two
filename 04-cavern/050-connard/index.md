Swingle's file says that Marquis de Connard threw himself into the volcano. You should check [the volcano area](../120-kalaua-island/030-volcano/index.md).

# Nora
Nora didn't know anything about marquis. Maybe her sister is more of help. Go to Gofuku Island and [help Dora with the flower](../100-gofuku-island/050-flower/index.md).

# Found him
He died in the flower but the keystone is somewhere in the volcano. Get the climbing equipment to Nora.

# I am up there
The keystone must be somewhere. [Get rid of Nono](../120-kalaua-island/030-volcano/020-nono.md), first.

# Done
The keystone is in the fissure.
