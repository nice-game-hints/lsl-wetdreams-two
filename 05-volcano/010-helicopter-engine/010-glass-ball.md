You would need to build a glass ball. You know how they make glass objects?

# How?
They _blow_ the glass to its shape using this rod. The glass must be really hot.

# Okay
There's a metal pipe on the floor. That would work.

# And the glass?
There is a test tube on the floor near the elevator.

# Got them
Combine them and heat the glass.

# How?
Use the lava flow.

# It would come off
You have to attach the test tube into the metal rod.

# How?
Use tape. You can find it next to the strange machine. After securing the test tube use the thing on the lava. You get a nice glass bottle.
