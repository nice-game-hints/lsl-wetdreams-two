Muffington islander female cannibals threw Larry into the prison!

# How to get out?
The key is to open the airplane door. The lamp shows if it is locked. As the lamp is red, the door is locked at the moment.

# Any more specifics?
Clearly, the lamp needs electricity. The cable has two gaps in it. One on the left and the other on the upper right.

Note that you can call the guard in by clicking on the door.

# More hands on
 - [Fix the right gap](040-right-gap.md)
 - [Fix the left gap](030-left-gap.md)

# They are fixed
Then just [open the fuse box](020-fuse-box.md) and push the button.
