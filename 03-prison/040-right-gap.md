The right hand gap is little farer away.

# How to connect those?
Maybe you could use some help.

# From?
Swingle! Look at the gap first. Then you can ask Swingle to help you. He will be thrilled to help.

# It is too far
I tell you a little secret. The [switch controls the cage](050-switch.md)!

# He is up now
Ask him to grab the cable.
