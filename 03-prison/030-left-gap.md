There is a gap in the cable. You could bypass it with your hand but that would toast your hands!

# What then?
Have you discussed with the guard, already? ^[ You can get her in by clicking the door. ]

# Yes
Do you know what they were talking about?

# No, I can't hear
Try to find something you can hear better with. ^[ There is a stethoscope in the hand luggage compartment. ]

# I have it
Now, listen what they talk by using the stethoscope on the airplane door.

# Interesting...
The guard you can talk with would like to see man's... stuff.

# Larry has...
Call in the guard and talk to her about it. Say that you are above average. She will give you some food.

# What do I do with that?
Well, if a finger can conduct electricity I think sausage can do that too.

# Right!
Put the sausage into the left gap.

# What then?
Send some electricity from [the fuse box](020-fuse-box.md).
