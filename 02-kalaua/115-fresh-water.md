The pool water smells terrible. It needs more good smells.

# Where?
Did you [get into the toilet](050-toilet.md), already?

# Yes
Well, there are the air fresheners. Take them and put them into the water treatment plant opening.

# Done
Now, make the water blue. ^[ Take the blue paint from the buffet room and pour it into the water treatement plan opening. ]
