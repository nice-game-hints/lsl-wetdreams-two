As if he is okay. He says he will is drinking coffee from the buffet table.

# Right?
Maybe you could help him sleep.

Make the coffee more sleepy.

Get some sleeping pills from Bobbi's desk and put them into the coffee pot. You might need to add the pills multiple times.

Visit other places. At some point he will be sleeping.

# He is sleeping!
Take the quarter from the tip jar.
