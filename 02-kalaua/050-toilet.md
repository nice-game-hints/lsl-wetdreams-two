There is a toilet in the jungle (right from the hotel yard).

# It is locked
There is the old box for the key at the hotel reception. Click it and Kip tells that the key is lost at the beach.

# Lost?
Someone is looking for all kinds of carbage from the beach.

# Emma!
Yup. Go talk to her and ask about the key.
