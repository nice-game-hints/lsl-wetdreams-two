Someone has cut the yellow wire in the electric panel.

# How to fix it?
You should fix it with something that transfers electricity. Like, metal.

# Metal?
Have you done dumpster diving, yet?

# No?
Go check the dumpster in front of the hotel.

# I found something
It is a _tin_ foil hat.

# So?
Use it on the yellow wire to fix it.
