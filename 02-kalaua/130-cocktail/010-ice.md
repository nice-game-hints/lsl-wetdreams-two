How to make ice.

# Yes, how
First, you need a container. ^[ Take a plastic cup from the buffet table. ]

# I have it
Then, you need water. ^[ Take water from the fountain into the plastic cup. ]

# I got it
Then... do you guess it?

# Freeze it?
Correct. Put it into the minibar at [Faith's suite](../040-faith/010-faiths-room.md). Close the minibar door.

# And?
Wait for a while. Open the minibar and you have some ice. You can't carry it with you for long so [prepare the drink](index.md) as soon as the ice is ready.
