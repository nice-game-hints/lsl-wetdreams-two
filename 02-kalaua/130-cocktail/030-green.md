Tiki Twister really needs some green liquid. First, you need a container. ^[ Take a plastic cup from the buffet table. ]

# I have it
Now... green liquid. What else green have you seen?

# Hmm...
There is a juicy snake at Bobbi's office. Take it with you.

# A snake?
A _juicy_ snake!

# Oh...
Put the plastic cup on the spout. Put the snake into the juicer. Green snake juice!
