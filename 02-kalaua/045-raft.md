Emma has confisticated your raft. She says it is carbage.

# No it isn't
Agreed! Let's get rid of her.

# How?
Report her a serious pollution issue. Then she will leave.

# Nothing works
Maybe you could cause some [bad environmental catastrophe](080-pollution.md).

# I did it!
And Emma went to look at it? Great! Now you can lower the raft from the switch.

# We need propulsion
