Faith must've been here in Kalau'a. Ask if someone has seen her. Ask everyone. Bobbi already tells you that she had a room here.

# Where next?
Go ask Kip if he has seen Faith. Say that she is a beautiful woman. You need to describe her to him. ^[ She's tall and slender. Her eyes are blue. Her hair is short and blond. She was wearing a tight purple dress. ]

# He remembers!
Great. So Faith _was_ here! Go ask Bobbi more.

# What should I ask?
Say that you have to get out of the island. Then you can ask if you can [get into Faith's room](010-faiths-room.md).

# I am in Faith's room
There is the gold member card. That is the key to finding Faith.

# The key to where?
To the observation deck and [the telescope](../030-dollar.md).

# I have enough money!
Use the telescope to find hints about Faith.

# Pi!
Pi will ask if you managed to [piece out Faith's fate](020-whereabouts.md).
