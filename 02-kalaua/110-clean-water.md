The pool water is yuck! Where is it coming, even?

# Don't know
There is the water treatement next to the toilet in the jungle (right from the hotel).

# Okay?
That is your place.
 - Make the water blue. ^[ Take the blue paint from the buffet room and pour it into the water treatement plant opening. ]
