The electric panel is missing one lever.

# What to do?
Do you remember when, as a kid, you were instructre _not_ to stick forks into electric sockets.

# No?
Good, then you can solve this.

# How?
Stick the fork into the electric thing.

# Fork?
There is a meat fork at the buffet table. Use it on the empty lever socket.
