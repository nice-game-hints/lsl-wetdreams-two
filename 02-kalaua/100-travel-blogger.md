The travel blogger is Becky! Ask her how she rated the hotel on Gulp. ^[ You have to discuss with Bobbi first. ]

# Two stars?
She has numerous complaints. Each of them would change her mind by one star.
 - [The pool water should be clean and smell fresh.](110-clean-water.md)
 - [The hotel buffet should be completely vegan.](120-vegan-buffet.md)
 - [She wants to take a picture with selfie-worthy cocktail.](130-cocktail/index.md)

# Five stars!
Great! Go tell Bobbi about this.
