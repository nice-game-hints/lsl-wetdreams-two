You need something that works as a motor.

# What?
Something spinning.

# Like?
Like a fan. Lewis has a fan on top of his piano.

# It's so small
Have you talked with him? He is annoyed with the air conditioning.

# Okay?
Maybe you could make it more comfortable... or less.

# Less?
Set the [air conditioning](065-aircondition.md) to **hot**. Go check Lewis.

# Oh!
He has a bigger fan. Could you get it?

# No
Well, make it useless for him.

# How?
Turn the air condition to cool. Now he gives the propulsion, I mean fan, to you.
Go and attach it to the boat.
