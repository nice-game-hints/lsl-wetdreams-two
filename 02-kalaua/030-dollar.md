You would need a dollar to look with the telescope.

# Where?
Well, you would need coins. Four quarters make a dollar, to be exact.

# Four?
Do you want me to list them for you?

# Yes!
I tell you the clear ones, first.
 - There is [a quarter in Dip's tip jar](060-tipjar.md).
 - There is [a quarter on the table at Faith's room](040-faith/010-faiths-room.md).

# Where to get more?
Maybe you could wish more coins from the wishing fountain?

# Like, spend coins?
There are coins in the fountain. Look into it.

# How to get it from there?
Coins are metallic. ^[ Go get a magnet from Emma's locker. Use the magnet on the fountain to get the quarter. ]

# Where is the last one?
Haven't you found it already?

# No!
I'm fed up with this. Go get a soda and be done with it. Use your coins to buy one at the observation deck.

# Really
Yes. Go to the observation deck and put a quarter into the soda machine.

# Hey! It took my money!
Uhm.. click on the coin return.

# Yay!
You should now have four quarters. That is one dollar.
